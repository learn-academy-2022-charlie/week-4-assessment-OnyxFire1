3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP are objects and the interaction with those objects.
  
  OOP stores data in objects, functional programming does not.

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is programming that is based on the concept of objects. It arranges software design throughout data and objects instead of functions and logic.

  Functional programming and object-oriented programming uses different methods for storing and manipulating the data. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects, and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects.
